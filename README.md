# CSE 231 Advanced Computer Programming Project

Welcome to our project repository for CSE 231's Advanced Computer Programming Project! In this project, we have designed and implemented an application following the Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm. Our chosen application is a Course Management System, which allows users to manage various aspects of online courses, including different types of courses, users, quizzes, and more.

## Overview

The Course Management System is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing online courses. It allows administrators, instructors, and students to perform various tasks such as creating and enrolling in courses, managing assignments and quizzes, grading submissions, and more.
